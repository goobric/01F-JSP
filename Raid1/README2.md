To handle cases where the puzzle or list of words provided does not guarantee a unique solution, you can modify the crosswordSolver function to try all possible combinations of words and positions. This can be done using a recursive approach.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

- Modify the crosswordSolver function to take an additional parameter index which represents the current index in the wordPositions array.
- If index is equal to the length of wordPositions, check if all words have been used.
- If so, return the current puzzle
- Otherwise, return null.
- For each word in the list, if the word fits at the current position, replace the word in the puzzle and call crosswordSolver recursively with index + 1. 
- If the recursive call returns a non-null result, return that result.
If no word fits at the current position or all recursive calls return null, return null.
- In the initial call to crosswordSolver, if it returns a non-null result, print the result. Otherwise, print 'Error'.
